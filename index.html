guided by Jamaica Reyes and Richard Reyes, his childhood in Cabanatuan laid the groundwork for his character. Thriving academically, John Miccoh discovered passions in Computer, Journalism,
and Filipino, envisioning them as gateways to potential futures in film and computer industries. Beyond textbooks, his interests extended to dreams of becoming a pilot, sports athlete,
and matters of the heart. As he stands at the crossroads of adolescence, John Miccoh's narrative promises a future filled with passion, promise, and the pursuit of his wildest dreams,
a testament to resilience and loyalty in navigating the labyrinth of youth.</p>

<h1 class="titles">My  life and thoughts as a Scilinian</h1>
<br>
<p class="me">Everything changed in the seventh grade. My outlook on life, making wise decisions, and just getting things done. I recall that my life collapsed when the first quarter's grades were announced. It was the first time in my entire existence that I received an 82 in journalism and I didn't reach the honor list. I assumed that was where it would end. After another quarter, everything altered once more. With a 97 in journalism, I had a significant improvement and was included in the honor roll with an average of 90. Simply said, our lives shouldn't be dictated to us. Everything will occur at the appropriate moment.</p>

    <source src="Cup of Joe, Janine Teñoso  - _Tingin_ (Official Lyric Video).mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
<br><br>
<p class="Family">"Tingin" is a song about being completely smitten with someone and feeling content in their presence despite everything else going on around them. It is a powerful ode to the all-consuming nature of love and the desire to always be near the person that makes you whole. The song depicts the feeling of being captivated by someone's gaze and entranced by their presence, while everything else fades into the background.</p>

<h1 class="titles">My Physical Life</h1>
<br><br>
<p class="Family">It was a win-win for me to discover tennis as my sport. My uncle was playing the game overseas so he taught me some of the basics that he learned from there. As I started high school, I was presented with a lot of opportunities. I had a lot of interaction with SPJs. I first became incredibly passionate about sports when I represented the school as a finalist in the DSPC Finals for sports writing. It genuinely turned into one of my greatest experiences. I've started to become more physically active and fit now that I play sports. It enhanced my social abilities as well.
    For this school year, my dream is to join the different athletic meets such as CLRAA to test myself and improve more.</p>

<h1 class="titles">My Weakness</h1>
<br><br>
<p class="Family">My shoes have power over me. I always buy shoes when I'm really worried or have extra money. I have seven pairs of shoes at the moment, and they make me happy every time I look at them. Since reselling shoes is a rising business in our society, if I become successful one day, I also want to do it.</p>
<br><br><br><hr class="short"><br><br><br>
<h1 class="titles">My Experience Making This Site</h1>
<br><br>
<p class="Family">I had a range of emotions while creating this website. Boredom, laziness, and dizziness are the pressures I face in my quest to achieve the maximum score. However, creating this website forced me to pay more attention to the areas I wasn't really focusing on at the time. Making programs is a very labor-intensive task, however as previously stated. Similar to coding, achieving your goals takes time. Before passing the program, I most likely checked for mistakes. </p>
